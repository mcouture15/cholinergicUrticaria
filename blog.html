    	<h1>Blog</h1>
    	<p>This is our blog page where we encourage people to share their cholinergic urticaria stories. Weather you have overcome CU or are an everyday fighter with cholinergic urticaria. We gratefully appreciate your time to share what you are going through or have went through to overcome the illness. It's a great way to exchange Ideas and motivate yourself or others knowing that there are other people out there going through the same thing. Like I stated in my about page I had this condition for 2 and a half years. Hearing and talking to other people that were suffering or had overcome CU made it a lot easier to cope with because I learned great new idea's to try and see if they worked for me. So I ask everybody that's successful conquered cholinergic urticaria or is battling everyday with it to please share their stories in the post box below. </p>
    	<p>Please do NOT post spam or something unrelated to cholinergic urticaria. This page is specifically only for people that have or are suffering from cholinergic urticaria. Anything unrelated will be removed immediately and you will be blocked from ever being able to come back on this site. Thank you </p>

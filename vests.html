		 <h1>Vests</h1>
		 <p>The Cholinergic Urticaria Foundation is not only sending donations for research studies to Dr. Gordon Sussman, we are also giving back to people battling from Cholinergic Urticaria by sending them military ice pack vests. Cholinergic Urticaria can prevent you from: Going to school, working a job, enjoying your favorite hobbies/activities, playing sports, eating spicy foods, or even leaving your house on a hot sunny day.</p>
		 <p>By receiving one of our ice pack vests you will no longer have to worry about an embarrassing public breakout. Now you can go to school, work, and even enjoy some daily activities without breaking out in heat hives or a body rash. The ice pack vest will allow your body to still remain at a normal temperature while moving around and completing your regular routines. Firefighters and soldiers in the military use these vests when they go into very hot situations as it prevents their body from overheating. I received an ice pack vest while dealing with Cholinergic Urticaria and it was very helpful. It allowed me to continue going to school and participate in some of the day-day activities I loved doing. For example before receiving my ice pack vest I could not attend school because things like stress, anxiety, fear of breaking out in public, and gym class which increased my body's temperature and caused me to breakout in heat hives. After receiving my vest I could go to school and get through all of those things because my ice pack vest kept my body temperature at the same temperature it would normally be at. I could even participate in the odd gym activity. Don't get me wrong, you won't be able to run a marathon, but it still allows you to do the small things that you love doing.</p>
		 <p>The ice pack vests that we send out to our Cholinergic Urticaria customers come from another source. We do not manufacturer them ourselves, we just receive and distribute the vests safely to our customers that need them. Before sending them to our customers we ensure that the vests are safe and are ready for use with no damage or tears anywhere on the product. For legal issues we ask that anybody wanting an ice pack vest reads and signs our waiver below to ensure everyone remains safe and happy with the received product. Also, we ask that anybody in need of a vest contact one of our staff directly by email or phone.</p>

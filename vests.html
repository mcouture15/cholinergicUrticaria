		 <h1>Vests</h1>
		 <p>The Cholinergic Urticaria Foundation is not only sending donations for research studies to Dr. Gordon Sussman head of allergy/immunology research at the University Of Toronto. Were also giving back to people battling from cholinergic urticaria by sending them ice pack vests if they think they can benefit from it and it would be helpful to them. cholinergic urticaria can prevent you from: </p>
    	<p>>Going to school </p>
    	<p>>Working a job </p>
    	<p>>Enjoying your favorite hobbies/activities </p>
    	<p>>Playing Sports </p>
    	<p>>Eating spicy foods </p>
    	<p>>Leaving your house on a hot or sunny day </p>
    	<p>By receiving one of our ice pack vests you will no longer have to worry about an embarrassing public breakout or even worse not leaving your house at all. Now you can go to school, work, and even enjoy some daily activities without breaking out in heat hives or a body rash. The ice pack vest will allow your body to still remain at a normal cool temperature while moving around and completing your regularly routines. Military/Firefighting ice pack vests are used by firefighters and soldiers in the military for when they go into very hot situations and it prevents their body from overheating. I received an ice pack vest while I was going through cholinergic urticaria and it was very helpful and beneficial for me. It allowed myself to continue to go to school and still participate in some of the day-day activities I loved doing. For example before receiving my ice pack vest I could not attend school because things like stress, drama, fear of breaking out in public, gym class etc. Which all affected my thyroid by dropping my body's temperature by 1 or 2 degrees which caused me to breakout in heat hives. After receiving my vest I could go to school and get through all of those things because my ice pack vest kept my body temperature at the same climate as it would normally be at. I could even participate in the odd gym activity, don't get me wrong you won't be able to run a marathon but it still allows you to do the small things that you love doing. </p>
    	<p>The ice pack vests that we send out to our fighting cholinergic urticaria patients come from another source. We do not manufacturer them ourselves as we just receive them and distribute the vests safely as well as packaged to our customers that need them. Before sending them to our customers we ensure that the vests are safe and are ready for use with no damage or any tears anywhere on the product. For legal issues we ask that anybody wanting an ice pack vest read's and signs our waiver below to ensure everyone's safety and happy with receiving the product. Also we ask that anybody inquiring for a vest contacts one of our staff directly by email or phone. As our blog page is NOT a source of asking for a vest it is just a way for people to tell their cholinergic urticaria stories and different things they have been through battling or overcoming it. </p>

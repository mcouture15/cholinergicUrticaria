		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>The Cholinergic Urticaria Foundation was established in 2015. It was created to help motivate people suffering from cholinergic urticaria (CU) and also to develop heightened awareness for the condition. CU is a disease where you are allergic to your own body heat and limits you to very little activity.</p>
		<h2>Mission Statement</h2> 
		<p>Our Mission at CUF is to motivate people by sharing stories and generating new ideas for individuals that have been diagnosed with or overcome cholinergic urticaria. By visiting our Blog page you can see that although you may be suffering or depressed from the condition, there are other people out there battling as well, and there is hope of overcoming it. We also intend to help people suffering from embarrassing public breakouts or not being able to leave their house by sending them military/firefighting ice pack vests, which can help you enjoy daily activities and still go on with your normal active lifestyle.</p>
		<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
		<p>My foundation is motivated to raise money for both cholinergic urticaria research, which will be funded and sent to Dr. Gordon Sussman head of allergy/immunology at the University of Toronto, as well as to send people suffering from CU military/firefighting ice pack vests. Dr. Sussman has been practicing at his office at St Claire Ave (Toronto, Ontario) for over 30 years, and I believe the firefighting/ice pack vests can help many people live normal lives while suffering from CU.</p>
		<h2>Overview Of Cholinergic Urticaria</h2>
		<p>Cholinergic Urticaria is a condition caused by sweating or an overall increase in your body's temperature for those who have it and can't sweat. It's also known and referred to as heat bumps or a hive rash as the sweating or the warming of your body causes red bumps with red flares that show up from head to toe. It can be very painful and irritating, as the only way to get rid of the bumps or rash is too cool your body temperature. Individuals with cholinergic urticaria are limited to little activity, avoiding anything that causes an increase in their overall body temperature. Some examples that could cause a breakout include: Exercising, eating spicy food, becoming angry or upset, having a hot shower or bath, stress or anxiety, and sunshine or any sort of heat.</p>
		<h2>My Cholinergic Urticaria Story</h2>
		<p>For anybody that doesn't know me they should know that I suffered from this condition for just over 2 years. It was the two most awful years of my life, and through those two years I travelled all over seeing different doctors and trying different medications. It was an illness that my family and myself didn't totally understand and neither did anyone I talked to. Those years caused very stressful times resulting in a lot of bad things happening to me including losing friends, sports, and relationships. It completely changed whom I was because I didn't realize why it was happening and it took me for the worse, as I was a very depressed person. On top of not totally understanding the illness it was very hard to know what medications to try and also to afford these medications. For example I was trying needles that were $1000 a shot (chromosome shots ). Yes we had a bit of coverage on our health plan but it definitely didn't cover the full cost and, coming from a family where money is tight, it was very hard on everybody. That being said on April 7, 2011 I did overcome it. I never would have beaten it if it werenâ€™t for the help of a few different people that motivated me and really helped along the way.</p>
		<p>First off I would like to thank my family for driving me all over Ontario visiting many different doctors and taking time out of their busy lives to help me through some very rough period. Secondly, after seeing many doctors I would like to thank Dr. Gordon Sussman as he was the only doctor that took serious consideration into my condition and made me feel like I could overcome it. He cared about me and was always very enthusiastic and motivating. Sussman was consistently on board for trying new ideas and listening to things I had to say. Lastly and most importantly I would like to thank my best friend Andy Blackwell and his father James Blackwell who stuck with me through everything for two years and through the most depressing and suicidal time of my life. They gave me a place and home where I could be myself, as well as always taking me to places like resorts, concerts, and sporting events to keep my mind off everything. Andy would motivate me every day by calling me to hangout or with enthusiastic messages. Finally one day Andy and myself started running a couple days a week to try to "beat out the condition," as I couldn't sweat so we thought maybe we could run the sweat out of me. Andy would bike behind me with a bucket of water so when I broke out in my rash or was about to pass out from pain he could dump the water over me and we could quickly rush home for a cold shower or freezer. After a few weeks of trying this I woke up one day feeling great with sweaty palms and arm pits. I called Andy right away and said we had to run today. It was a school day so he said that we would have to do it at school in the gym at lunch. That day we ran, my whole body flooded with sweat and I haven't broken out or looked back since. April 7, 2011 was one of the best days of my life and I have all these amazing people to thank for it.</p>
		<p>I want everyone reading this to know I am not a doctor so I do not medically recommend this strategy. Everybody's Cholinergic Urticaria is different and is caused for different reasons. This was just my story and I thought that it would be important and a way to show people that you can overcome it no matter what way you get there. I do not know how to cure the condition but believe it can definitely motivate you to create your own ideas of things that may help. This just worked for me and I talked with my parents about it along with my doctor. I recommend anybody that would want to try this to take it up with his or her doctor, as, like I said above, I am not a doctor or nurse and would not want to see anybody get hurt from this.</p>

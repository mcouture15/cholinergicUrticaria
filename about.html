		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>The Cholinergic Urticaria Foundation was established & built in 2015. It was created to help motivate people suffering from cholinergic urticaria (CU) and also to develop heightened awareness for the condition. Cholinergic Urticaria is a medical term used to describe heat hives. This is an illness where you are allergic to your own body heat and limits you to very little activity. Here On our website you can find lots of important information and new idea's on cholinergic urticaria. Here you can gather a summary of the illness, read about causes and symptoms, talk to others and post on our live forum, study pictures, learn how you can help people by donating today, and much more.</p>
		<h2>Mission Statement</h2> 
		<p>Our Mission at CUF is to motivate people by sharing stories and generating new ideas for individuals that have been diagnosed with or overcome cholinergic urticaria. Also to create more awareness for the condition by conducting research projects with Dr. Gordon Sussman and being involved with the community.</p>
		<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
		<p>Our vision is to live in a world where everybody can sweat and be active.</p>
		<h2>Overview Of Cholinergic Urticaria</h2>
		<p>Cholinergic Urticaria is a condition caused by sweating or an overall increase in your body's temperature for those who have it and can't sweat. It's also known and referred to as heat bumps or a hive rash as the sweating or the warming of your body causes red bumps with red flares that show up from head to toe. It can be very painful and irritating, as the only way to get rid of the bumps or rash is too cool your body temperature. Individuals with cholinergic urticaria are limited to little activity, avoiding anything that causes an increase in their overall body temperature. Some examples that could cause a breakout include: Exercising, eating spicy food, becoming angry or upset, having a hot shower or bath, stress or anxiety, sunshine or any sort of heat.</p>
		<h2>Ways Of Helping Cholinergic Urticaria</h2>
		<p>As of right now there is still no found cure for the condition yet, but as many have found including myself there are many things and ways you can treat cholinergic urticaria that can make it less frustrating when dealing with it. There are also things you can do to prevent breakouts or very bad breakouts when in public or not in a comfortable environment like home.</p>
		<p><b>Appropriate clothing:</b> Make sure that whenever you are getting dressed you dress to keep your body at a cool temperature. Do not overdress (sometimes it's better to be cold then in pain and scratchy).</p>
		<p><b>Avoiding strong emotions:</b> It's hard to help but try to avoid any stress, drama or strong emotions while battling with this condition. Things like anger, crying, stress, anxiety, even laughter can all increase your overall body temperature and force your body to breakout.</p>
		<p><b>Exercise or Sweating:</b> This won't work for everyone but for the individuals that have mild cases of cholinergic urticaria this can sometimes help frequent attacks. The concept is to force your body to sweat so it gest used to it and hopefully sweats more frequently. however I would ask your doctor before trying this because some cases are more severe than others and will experience dizziness and could pass out.</p>
		<p><b>What you take In:</b> Eating spicy foods or even drinking beverages like alcohol are known to raise your body's overall temperature. These can often force your body to breakout in a rash very fast. Also try and stay away from drugs like aspirin , prescribed drugs and illegal street drugs because they too can raise your overall body's temperature.</p>
		<p><b>Cooling Down:</b> When you're going out somewhere it's always comforting having something with you that can cool you down in the moment of a breakout. (Ice pack vest, cold spray bottle, cold cloth around your neck) anything to keep you cool while you're out in public.</p>
		<p><b>Taking a hot shower:</b> In some cases having a hot shower can open up your pours and sweat glands more allowing your body to sweat easier throughout the day. I know a few cases where the only time the individual breaks out is if he DOES NOT have a hot shower the day of.</p>
		<h2>Cause Of Cholinergic Urticaria</h2>
		<p>As of right now it's still an unknown to doctors, scientist, and researchers on what the for sure cause is for this condition. If anything it almost seems like there may be different causes on why people get it. That is why we have teamed up with Dr. Gordon Sussman head of Allergy & Immunology at the University of Toronto. He also has been practicing at his office on St Clair Ave in Toronto, Ontario for over 30 years. We believe that donating some of our funds to his research studies can really make a difference in finding a cure someday. Also having a live blog allows Individuals that want can take part in live research studies as Dr Sussman always needs patients that suffer with cholinergic urticaria to come take part in the different studies he does.</p>
		<h2>Cholinergic Urticaria Symptoms</h2>
		<p><b>Prickly/Tingly feeling on the skin:</b> As your body starts to get warmer and heat up individuals may start to feel a tingly/prickly feeling all over their skin. This usually is the feeling you get when the hives or heat rash is just starting to arise.</p>
		<p><b>Burning Skin:</b> Your skin may start to feel like its burning in a very uncomfortable way. Your body may start to get flush red and the rash can sometimes have a warmth to it.</p>
		<p><b>Hives or Small Welts:</b> If every time you go do an activity or do something that actively increases your body temperature to break out in hives or small welts all over your body. Then there's a good chance that you most likely have cholinergic urticaria.</p>
		<p><b>Reduced Sweating:</b> You may notice that every time you go to do an activity or be active you breakout in this rash and can't sweat. Individuals can sometimes even find it hard to sweat on a hot sunny day, Instead of sweating your overall body temperature just continues to rise and you remain scratchy in pain.</p>
		<p><b>Red Rash:</b> Experiencing red blotches all over your body instead of hives or just before the hives come sometimes as a warning their coming. This is caused by the blood vessels leaking fluid near the skins surface. The red blotch is usually warm and may be itchy. Individuals scratching the rash can sometimes experience it get worse or spread due to the warmth of friction while scratching.</p>
		<p><b>Small Wheals:</b> Tiny wheals may appear when the individual scratches one area on his body more then he normally would. These will often disappear once the hives start to rise or shortly after your cooled down.</p>
		<p>Although you may have Cholinergic Urticaria it doesn't mean you will display all of these symptoms. These are just few of many different symptoms that people have experienced in the past dealing with cholinergic urticaria. If you have any of the following symptoms above I would recommend seeing your doctor and asking him about it.</p>

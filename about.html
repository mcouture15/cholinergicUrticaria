		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>The Cholinergic Urticaria Foundation was established in 2015, It was created to help motivate people suffering from cholinergic urticaria and also to gain more awareness for the condition. CU is a disease where you are allergic to your own body heat and limits you to very little activity.</p>
		<h2>Mission Statement</h2> 
		<p>Our Mission at CUF is to motivate people by sharing other stories of suffering and successful human beings that have been diagnosed or overcome cholinergic urticaria. By visiting our blog page you can see that although you may be suffering and depressed there are other people out there battling as well and there is hope of overcoming it as you can see below I have overcome it myself. Also to help people from an embarrassing public breakout or not being able to leave their house at all by sending them Military/Firefighting Ice pack vests which can help you enjoy your daily activities and still go on with your normal active lifestyle.</p>
		<h2>Vision Statement</h2>
		<p>My foundations hopes to raise money for both cholinergic urticaria research which will be funded and sent to Dr. Gordon Sussman head of allergy/immunology at the University of Toronto also has been practicing at his office at St Claire Ave (Toronto, Ontario) for over 30 years. Furthermore to raise money to send people Military/Firefighting Ice pack vest which helped me and I believe can help many people still live normal lives while suffering from the condition</p>
		<h2>Overview Of Cholinergic Urticaria</h2>
		<p>" Dr Sussman is going to give me a write up for this section. There are too many scientific (big words) that are used to describe it that he is going to add that I can't lol. I will have a brief overview of the disease shortly for this part but I really want to add this part in the about page or home page so people that come across the website or my story know what this condition is before reading my story"</p>
		<h2>My Cholinergic Urticaria Story</h2>
		<p>For anybody that doesn't know me they should know that I suffered from this condition for just over 2 years. It was the 2 most awful years of my life, through those two years I travelled all over seeing different doctors and trying different medications. It was an illness that my family or myself didn't totally understand and neither did anyone I talked too. Those years caused very stressful times resulting in a lot of bad things happening to me including loosing friends, sports, relationships, etc. It completely changed whom I was because I didn't realize why this was happening and it took me for the worse, as I was a very depressed person. On top of not understanding the illness totally it was very hard to know what medications to try and also to afford these medications. For example I was trying needles that were $1000 a shot (medication name shortly). Yes we had a bit of coverage on our health plan but it definitely didn't cover the full cost and coming from a family where money is tight, it was very hard on everybody. That being said on April 7th 2011 I did overcome it but I never would have beat it if it wasn't for the help of a few different people that motivated me and really helped me along the way.</p>
		<p>First off I would like to thank my family for driving me all over Ontario visiting many different doctors and taking time out of their busy lives to help myself through some very rough times. Secondly after seeing many doctors I would like to thank Dr. Gordon Sussman as he was the only doctor that actually took serious consideration into me and made me feel like I could overcome it. He actually cared about myself and was always very enthusiastic and motivating. Sussman was consistently on board for trying new idea's or listening to anything I had to say. Lastly and most importantly I would like to thank my best friend Andy Blackwell and his father James Blackwell who stuck with me through everything for 2 years and through the most depressing/suicidal time of my life. They gave me a place/home where I could be myself as well as always  taking me places like resorts, concerts, games etc to keep my mind off everything. When I went to these places I either wore an Ice pack vest or carried a squirt bottle that kept me cool. A lot of these times I had people giving me dirty looks or chirping me in public because they didn't understand why I had these things or why I would break out in this rash and Andy or his father would be the first there to defend me or to calm me down. Andy would motivate me every day by calling me to hangout or with enthusiastic messages. Finally one day Andy and myself started running a couple days a week to try and "beat out the condition", as I couldn't sweat so we thought maybe we could run the sweat out of me. Andy would bike behind me with a bucket of water so when I broke out in my rash or was about to pass out from pain he could dump the water over myself and we could quickly rush home for a cold shower or freezer. Conclusively after a few weeks of trying this I woke up one day feeling great with sweaty palms and arm pits. I called Andy right away and said we had to run today. It was a school day so he said that we would have to do it at school in the gym at lunch. That day we ran, my whole body flooded with sweat and I haven't broke out or looked back since. April 7th 2011 was one of the best days of my life and I have all these amazing people to thank for it !! </p>
		<p>I want everyone reading this to know I am NOT a doctor so I don't recommend anyone to try this. Everybody's Cholinergic Urticaria is different and are caused for different reasons. This was just MY story and I thought that it would be important and a way to show people that you can overcome it no matter what way you get there.  I don't know how to cure the condition or fix anybody but it can definitely motivate you to create your own idea's or thoughts to think of things that may help. This just worked for myself and I talked with my parents about it along with my doctor. I recommend anybody that would want to try this to take it up with your doctor/parents as like I said above I am NOT a doctor or nurse and would not want to see anybody get hurt from this.</p>
